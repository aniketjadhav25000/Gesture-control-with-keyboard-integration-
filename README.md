This project leverages hand gesture recognition to create an innovative and interactive way of controlling a virtual keyboard and mouse. By using computer vision techniques powered by MediaPipe and Python libraries like OpenCV and PyAutoGUI, users can perform tasks such as typing or navigating a computer without physically touching any device. It is particularly beneficial for accessibility solutions, futuristic computing interfaces, and hands-free applications.
